# On-Chain FDIC Insurance DApp

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: This project is NOT affiliated with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). It's an educational demonstration only. See [DISCLAIMER.md](./DISCLAIMER.md) for full legal notice.

This repository contains the code for an **On-Chain FDIC Insurance Decentralized Application (DApp)**, which simulates insurance mechanisms similar to those provided by traditional deposit insurance using Ethereum smart contracts and a React.js frontend.

## Project Overview
The On-Chain FDIC Insurance DApp is a conceptual demonstration of how deposit insurance can be managed in a decentralized manner using blockchain technology. It allows:
- **Regulators** to register banks and mark them as failed.
- **Depositors** to deposit funds into registered banks.
- **Depositors** to claim insurance if a bank fails.

**Note:** This project is for educational purposes and should not be used in production environments.

## Features
- **Smart Contract**: Implements the FDIC insurance logic using Solidity.
- **Frontend DApp**: Allows users to interact with the smart contract via a user-friendly interface.
- **Ethers.js v6 Integration**: Updated to work with the latest version of Ethers.js.
- **Wallet Support**: Compatible with MetaMask and can be extended to support other wallets.

## Technologies Used
- **Solidity**: Smart contract development.
- **Truffle**: Development environment for Ethereum.
- **React.js**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Ethers.js v6**: Library for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Ganache**: Local blockchain for development and testing.
- **MetaMask**: Browser extension for interacting with the Ethereum network.

## Installation and Setup
Please refer to the [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) file for detailed installation and deployment instructions.

## Usage
After installation and deployment, you can interact with the DApp by:
- **Depositing Funds**: Enter the bank's address and the amount you wish to deposit.
- **Claiming Insurance**: If a bank fails, you can claim insurance up to the insured amount.
- **Regulator Actions**: Using Truffle Console, you can register banks and mark them as failed.
